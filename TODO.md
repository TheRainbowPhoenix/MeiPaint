# TODO
The app is sideloaded on the tab6
It uses the NativeLib of medibang, idea is to kick crap out and have a nice app with no spyware
Src from JADX : C:\Users\Phoebe\Downloads\mediBangPaint\jadx (app-unmangled.jadx)

## What to do
- Migrate the base layouts from AppCompat to Compose (and learn Kotlin)
- Try to implement every native call on the PaintActivity (from jadx)
- Reimplement basic app flow (home screen => "new", "gallery")
- Try to open source te brush more
- Bring back every vital lib used on the app to kotlin compose
  - It is possible to use ad-hoc ? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75132431/is-it-possible-to-mix-jetpack-compose-with-components-that-are-not-available-in/75132623#75132623
